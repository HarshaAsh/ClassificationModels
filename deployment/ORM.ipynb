    "## Flask webapp\n",
    "In this blog, we will be using a python webserver called *Flask*. Flask is simple, light and customisable that can generate simple webapps with a few pages, read/set cookies and connect to databases using ORM's. To use the ORM, we have to first develop a flask app. One of the important things to set up in an ORM is the list of models. Models are python objects that map onto entities in the database. For example, we want a *historic_pollution* table with a row for each date in the past. The ORM object will generate python objects for each row allowing us to easily work with rows in python rather than in SQL. One of the main jobs of the ORM is to notice changes of the python object and construct SQL statements to automatically modify the database accordingly.  \n",
    "The flask app is present in the github repository [flask-web-app]() with the coplete code discussed here.  \n",
    "Inside the app folder, we have a file called *models.py*. This holds our database models, and tells us how Python is going to translate between data in the database tables and python objects. We are defining two python classes here. Each of them maps direcly onto a table in the database. Each of the lines inside the class tells how to treat one of the columns in the database. For instance, we have date, type and value in the daily_historic_pollution table, and for each of them we have to tell SqlAlchemy the type. We can also mention the primary key, index and uninque columns etc. This file allows SqlAlchemy to do two things:  \n",
    "1. Read from the database  \n",
    "2. Build SQL statements and execute them  "
