# Data science using python
Hi. My name is Harsha Achyuthuni. I am currently working as a data science consultant at Deloitte while studying MSc in Business analytics at Imperial college London (part-time). This website is a replica of my blog www.harshaash.com. While the blog at harshaash.com is built using R codes, the posts in this repo contain the same content, but using python.
